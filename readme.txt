This plugin was essentially developed for iPad but can work on all iOS devices.

This plugin uses Zepto javascript framework to attach swipe event to the iPad. 

Users will see a message box on home page or single post, informing them that they can use swipe to turn pages. By default visitors will see this message for 5 visits or till they just close the message box.There is a setting to change the number of times to show message on iPad Swipe settings page. 

If "All" option is selected for "Apply to" on settings page , it will allow to swipe posts on iPad, iPod and iPhone. Also you can add your own message to be shown to the users.
